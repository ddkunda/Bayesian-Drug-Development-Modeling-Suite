## Bayesian Modeling Suite: Advanced Tools for Drug Development Analysis

#### Welcome to the Bayesian Modeling Suite, a Shiny App designed to streamline Bayesian analysis for drug development. 

This app provides three advanced modeling tools to support preclinical and clinical research:

- Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling: Implements a Bayesian hierarchical model for two-group analysis, incorporating priors and group variability to improve decision-making in preclinical research.

- Bayesian Dose-Response Modeling: Performs Bayesian dose-response analysis, estimating target effect probabilities and visualizing uncertainty to optimize drug efficacy.

- Bayesian Toxicity Analysis Using Logistic Regression: Utilizes Bayesian logistic regression to estimate toxicity probability and determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), balancing efficacy and safety in drug trials.

To ensure fast and efficient analysis, this app relies on the MyStanPkg R package, which provides pre-compiled Stan models to eliminate model compilation time. You can download and install MyStanPkg from its GitHub repository ([ddkunda/MyStanPkg](https://github.com/ddkunda/MyStanPkg)).
